A lesson being taught by buildspace as beginner web3 developer course. 

I have tried several methods provided by solidity and etheres.js which was the core of web3 with ethereum.

I have implemented a bit more functional website rather than using same as the course with a bit add feature as block which we can block the user.

Please do check the code and make edits if any are there :)
